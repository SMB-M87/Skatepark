# Skatepark
This project was build with OpenGL and C++ from scratch using the freeglut, glew and glm libraries. Only the skateboard model was imported and made with Blender(Not a masterpiece). Meaning that all other shapes were made by using a Cube, Prism, Cylinder, Sphere, Torus or a combination of those models. These models were made by calculating the needed vertices, normals and uv's. It doesn't seem like much but that was a tedious and insightfull task.
